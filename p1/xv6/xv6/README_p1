For the most part I ran through the xv6 directory using grep to search
for one of the existing system calls. Per file, I added an entry for the
two additonal system calls where it was neccessary.

Finally, noticing that the syscall(void) function is the pivot of all
system calls made, I decided it was the best spot to increment system
calls and successful system calls.

For this I assumed that the system call is considered to be incremented 
if it actually exists. So if the initially if statement consideres it to
be an 'unknown sys call' I did not increment. Secondly, in order to
determin whether the call was successful I check the return value in the
register eax. I assumed that anything >= 0 should be considered good,
however, the scripts failed. This led me to only consider system calls
with return value of -1 to be unsuccessful.
