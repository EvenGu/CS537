CS537 P5 - File System Integrity(Checksum)

The kernel was edited on the writei and readi paths such that the file
type of T_CHECKED included a checksum when handling the file. This is 
done by XORing the data bytes across the file and storing in the top 
byte for future comparisons. Several changes were needed as such to
differentiate the file types. Additionally, two functions were added to
compute the checksum and write it to the file as we are executing writei.

Finally the filestat.c file uses the fstat() system call which takes in
a file path and output the type/size/checksum of such a file. Very minor
changes were needed to implement this such as editing the stat.h file.
