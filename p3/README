CS537 - Fall 2015
P3

This program involved manipulation of the process memory allocation of the
stack and heap. Rather than being statically allocated, the process can
now grow both the heap and stack dynamically as needed. 

The heap grows dynamically upwards, while the stack grows downwards
starting from the highest addressible space. If an operation will try
to allocate the last page between the stack and the heap, the OS will
kill the process.

All testing is included in the user directory with the names specified
as in the project spec:
	null.c
	null-syscall.c
	badaddress-syscall.c
	small-stack.c
	stack-growth.c
	fault.c
	malloc.c
	overcommit-stack.c
	overcommit-heap.c

Also, if all tests are to be ran, simply run:
	tester.c
